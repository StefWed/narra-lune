**Welcome to NarraLune – your playful guide through the world of books!**
NarraLune is like a digital treasure hunt for your next favorite read. Part game, part
book-matching companion, it's your personal librarian. Whether you read one book a year or devour a stack a week, 
NarraLune helps you discover books in fun, creative ways. 

It all starts with reading challenge prompts — playful tasks that ask you to find books based on cover designs, genres, 
settings, themes, characters, or even a single word in the title. Some are easy, others might send you digging through 
library stacks or calling a bookish friend for help.

The idea is to step outside your usual reading patterns: read more, read differently, and get creative. To inspire 
you even more, the app includes a curated selection of book recommendations.

And to make it a shared adventure, we’ve added a Reading Bingo game — you’ll find that on the second page.

So...
Pack your bookmarks.
Sharpen your TBR list.
And step into the story.
