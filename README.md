The purpose of the ReadingQuest project is to create an interactive reading challenge platform that helps users discover books based on specific reading challenge prompts. It utilizes a personal database of books, popular reading challenges (such as the 2025 Popsugar Reading Challenge), and related prompts. The project incorporates AI-driven recommendations using semantic search to match books to challenge prompts. Built with Streamlit, the app offers a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction. The goal is to motivate readers through personalized recommendations and gamified challenges, enhancing their reading experience.
